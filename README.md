CELERY MAN
==========
About
-----
CELERY MAN is a Bash script to run your dancers, like Paul Rudd in [this Tim & Eric clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHWBEK8w_YY).

Recently, I learned about Bash scripting in Systems Programming, and wanted to do something fun. I had seen Bahamas10's [node-celery-man](https://github.com/bahamas10/node-celery-man) and wanted to implement this using Bash. Thus, here is Celery Man.

Usage
-----
```shell
  celeryman
```
loads a dancing celery man.

```shell
  celeryman tayne
```

generates Tayne doing a [hat wobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHWBEK8w_YY).

Credits

The ASCII files for the dancing celery man are from the original [node-celery-man](https://github.com/bahamas10/node-celery-man).
